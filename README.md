# Chimera: Next-Gen NVIDIA-Powered AI Intelligence Platform

A modular, event-driven, GPU-accelerated platform for ingesting, analyzing, and delivering personalized AI intelligence across the global AI ecosystem.

## Architecture Overview

Chimera leverages a highly modular, event-driven microservice architecture orchestrated on Kubernetes, optimized for extreme-scale AI processing using NVIDIA's accelerated computing stack.

* **Microservice Framework & Event Bus**: NATS JetStream for persistent, high-throughput, low-latency messaging
* **GPU Compute Fabric**: Kubernetes with NVIDIA GPU Operator on Lambda Labs GPU instances (A100/H100)
* **Hybrid Backend**: Rust (Axum) for high-throughput services, Python (FastAPI) for ML orchestration
* **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with role-specific dashboards and real-time updates
* **Intelligence Pipeline**: Sub-minute latency pipeline for data ingestion, validation, enrichment, analysis, and delivery

## Key Components

* **Ingestion Services**: Plugin-based system for diverse data sources
* **Validation Services**: Data credibility assessment
* **NLP Enrichment**: GPU-accelerated summarization and NLP using BART/PEGASUS
* **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j-based graph with entity and relationship extraction
* **Trend Analysis**: Predictive insights and anomaly detection
* **Personalization Engine**: Vector embeddings for tailored content delivery
* **Delivery Service**: Real-time insights via WebSockets to role-specific dashboards
