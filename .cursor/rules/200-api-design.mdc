## API Design
- Version endpoints (e.g., `/v1/`). Maintain backward compatibility within versions.
- Validate requests strictly; return 4xx for client errors.
- Use consistent JSON response format for success and errors.
- Utilize standard HTTP methods and status codes correctly.

## NIM Integration
- Sanitize input for NIM unicode compatibility (see `nim.rs`).
- Document required NIM environment variables.
- Centralize handling of NIM-specific parameters/workarounds.

## Routing
- Ensure routing logic is deterministic and clearly documented.
- Log routing decisions and selected backends.
- Define and test fallback strategies for routing failures.
