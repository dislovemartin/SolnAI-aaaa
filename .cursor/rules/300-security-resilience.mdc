## Security
- Never log API keys or sensitive payload data.
- Load secrets exclusively from environment variables.
- Validate and sanitize all external inputs (request bodies, headers, query params).

## Resilience
- Apply rate limits per API key/IP (configurable).
- Implement circuit breakers with exponential backoff and jitter for backend calls.
- Use TTL-based caching for deterministic responses; consider cache invalidation needs.
- Exempt `/health` and `/metrics` from auth and rate limiting.
