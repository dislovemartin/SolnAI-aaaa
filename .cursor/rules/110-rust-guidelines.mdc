## Error Handling
- Use the custom `GatewayApiError` enum consistently.
- Implement `From`/`TryFrom` for error conversions.
- Ban `unwrap()`/`expect()` in production code; use `?`.
- Provide context-rich error messages.

## Async & Performance
- Adhere to Tokio best practices; avoid blocking calls.
- Apply timeouts to all I/O operations.
- Ensure graceful shutdown for all services.
- Leverage `Arc` for shared state; minimize `clone()` calls.
- Use newtypes and enums for strong type safety.
- Cache results of expensive operations.
