## Unit Tests (`src/`)
- Test core logic functions and modules in isolation.
- Mock external dependencies (HTTP clients, config sources).
- Aim for high coverage of logic branches and error conditions.

## Integration Tests (`tests/`)
- Test full request flows through the API (e.g., `proxy` function).
- Verify interactions between components (auth, cache, routing, NIM).
- Validate error responses and status codes for different failure scenarios.
- Include tests for resilience features (rate limiting, circuit breaking).

## Documentation Tests (`///`)
- Ensure code examples in public API documentation are correct and compile.
