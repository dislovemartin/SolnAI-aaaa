## Logging
- Use structured JSON logging (configurable via `observability.json_logging`).
- Include a unique request ID in all logs related to a request.
- Log key events: request start/end, errors, backend calls, routing decisions.
- Adhere to standard log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG).

## Metrics
- Expose Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`.
- Track request latency, status codes, cache performance, circuit breaker states.

## Health Checks
- Provide `/health/readiness` (includes dependency checks) and `/health/liveness`.
- Ensure health checks are fast and reflect actual service availability

## Ops Documentation
- Maintain runbooks and config examples.
- Track changes in a structured changelog.
