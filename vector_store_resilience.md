# Vector Store Resilience Strategy

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive backup and monitoring strategy implemented for the Redis vector storage system, addressing one of the key technical risks identified in the original specification.

## 1. Backup Architecture

- **Hybrid Storage Approach**
  - Redis RDB snapshots for metadata persistence
  - FAISS index serialization for vector data
  - S3 with AES-256 encryption for durable storage
  - Local caching for fast recovery

## 2. Operational Safeguards

- **Consistency Guarantees**
  - Atomic backup operations
  - Metadata validation
  - Index size verification
  - Redis key count validation

## 3. Monitoring & Observability

- **Prometheus Metrics**
  ```
  vector_store_backup_duration_seconds
  vector_store_backup_success_total
  vector_store_backup_failure_total
  vector_store_backup_size_bytes
  vector_store_vector_count
  vector_store_operation_duration_seconds
  vector_store_operation_errors_total
  vector_store_last_backup_timestamp
  vector_store_backup_age_seconds
  ```

## 4. Recovery Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**
  - Local restore: < 5 minutes
  - S3 restore: < 15 minutes
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**
  - Default: 24 hours (daily backups)
  - Configurable based on business requirements

## 5. Retention Policy

- **Tiered Retention**
  - Daily backups: 7 days
  - Weekly backups: 4 weeks
  - Monthly backups: 6 months
- **Automated Cleanup**
  - Policy-based retention enforcement
  - Secure deletion from both local and S3 storage

## 6. Implementation Details

- **Technology Stack**
  - Redis for metadata storage
  - FAISS for vector indices
  - S3 for durable backup storage
  - Prometheus for monitoring
  - Kubernetes CronJob for scheduling

## 7. Operational Benefits

- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Addresses data durability concerns
  - Provides disaster recovery capabilities
  - Enables point-in-time recovery
- **Monitoring & Alerting**
  - Real-time backup status tracking
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Automated failure detection
- **Compliance Support**
  - Audit trail of backup operations
  - Encrypted storage for sensitive data
  - Configurable retention policies

This enhancement significantly strengthens the platform's resilience and directly addresses one of the key technical risks identified in the original specification. The implementation provides a production-grade solution that balances performance, reliability, and operational simplicity while meeting industry best practices for data protection and monitoring.
