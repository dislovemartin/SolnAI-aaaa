# Vector Store Backup & Restore Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the backup and restore strategy for the AI-Driven Personalization Engine's Vector Store component, which manages both Redis metadata and FAISS indices. The implementation provides a robust, consistent backup mechanism with configurable retention policies and verification capabilities.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Redis Storage**

   - Stores metadata and vector data in JSON format
   - Uses RDB snapshots for point-in-time backups
   - Keys prefixed with `chimera-vectors:` and `chimera-users:`

2. **FAISS Indices**

   - In-memory vector indices for fast similarity search
   - Two separate indices:
     - Content index: For content embeddings
     - User index: For user profile embeddings
   - Serialized to disk during backup

3. **Backup Storage**
   - Primary: Local filesystem (`/tmp/vector_store_backup` by default)
   - Secondary: S3 bucket (optional) with server-side encryption
   - Structured backup format with metadata

### Backup Method

1. **Backup Process**

   ```
   /tmp/vector_store_backup/
   └── {backup_id}/
       ├── metadata.json       # Backup metadata and verification info
       ├── content_index.faiss # Serialized content vector index
       └── user_index.faiss    # Serialized user vector index
   ```

2. **Consistency Guarantees**
   - Atomic Redis RDB snapshot
   - Consistent FAISS index state capture
   - Metadata validation during restore
   - Size and integrity verification

### Backup Schedule & Retention

1. **Frequency**

   - Daily backups: Every 24 hours
   - Weekly backups: Every Monday
   - Monthly backups: First day of each month

2. **Retention Policy**

   - Daily backups: 7 days
   - Weekly backups: 4 weeks
   - Monthly backups: 6 months

3. **Storage & Security**
   - Local storage for fast recovery
   - S3 with AES-256 encryption for durability
   - Automatic cleanup of expired backups

## Recovery Process

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- Target: < 5 minutes for local restore
- Target: < 15 minutes for S3 restore

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- Target: < 24 hours (based on daily backup frequency)
- Configurable based on business requirements

### Restore Procedure

1. Download backup from S3 (if needed)
2. Verify backup metadata and integrity
3. Load FAISS indices from serialized files
4. Verify index sizes match metadata
5. Reconnect to Redis (loads RDB automatically)
6. Verify Redis key counts
7. Resume normal operation

## Monitoring & Verification

### Backup Monitoring

- Success/failure metrics
- Backup size and duration
- S3 upload status
- Storage usage tracking

### Backup Verification

- Automatic integrity checks
- Index size validation
- Redis key count verification
- Manual verification command available

### Health Checks

- Backup freshness monitoring
- Storage space monitoring
- S3 connectivity checks
- Redis connectivity validation

## Implementation Details

### Key Methods

1. `backup()`

   ```python
   async def backup(
       self,
       backup_id: Optional[str] = None,
       upload_to_s3: bool = True
   ) -> str:
   ```

   - Creates timestamped backup
   - Triggers Redis RDB snapshot
   - Exports FAISS indices
   - Generates metadata
   - Optionally uploads to S3

2. `restore()`

   ```python
   async def restore(
       self,
       backup_id: str,
       download_from_s3: bool = True
   ) -> None:
   ```

   - Downloads backup if needed
   - Verifies metadata
   - Loads indices
   - Reconnects to Redis
   - Verifies data integrity

3. `verify_backup()`

   ```python
   async def verify_backup(
       self,
       backup_id: str
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
   ```

   - Checks backup integrity
   - Validates index sizes
   - Returns verification report

4. `cleanup_old_backups()`
   ```python
   async def cleanup_old_backups(
       self,
       retain_days: int = 7,
       retain_weekly: int = 4,
       retain_monthly: int = 6
   ) -> None:
   ```
   - Implements retention policy
   - Removes expired backups
   - Cleans up both local and S3 storage

### Configuration

```python
class VectorStore:
    def __init__(
        self,
        backup_dir: str = "/tmp/vector_store_backup",
        s3_bucket: Optional[str] = None,
        s3_prefix: str = "vector_store_backups"
    ):
```

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error capture
- Automatic cleanup on failure
- Detailed error logging
- Retry mechanisms for S3 operations

## Usage Examples

1. **Create Backup**

   ```python
   backup_id = await vector_store.backup(upload_to_s3=True)
   ```

2. **Restore from Backup**

   ```python
   await vector_store.restore(
       backup_id="20240215_120000",
       download_from_s3=True
   )
   ```

3. **Verify Backup**

   ```python
   results = await vector_store.verify_backup("20240215_120000")
   ```

4. **List Available Backups**

   ```python
   backups = await vector_store.list_backups()
   ```

5. **Clean Up Old Backups**
   ```python
   await vector_store.cleanup_old_backups(
       retain_days=7,
       retain_weekly=4,
       retain_monthly=6
   )
   ```

## Operational Considerations

### Performance Impact

- Backup operations are non-blocking
- Redis RDB snapshot uses copy-on-write
- FAISS index serialization is memory-intensive
- S3 operations are async

### Resource Requirements

- Disk space: ~2x size of Redis + FAISS data
- Memory: Temporary spike during FAISS serialization
- Network: S3 upload/download bandwidth

### Security

- S3 server-side encryption (AES-256)
- IAM role-based access control
- Secure local file permissions
- No sensitive data in metadata

### Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics for backup operations
- Alerting on backup failures
- Storage usage monitoring
- Backup freshness tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Incremental Backups**

   - Implement delta backups for Redis
   - Track FAISS index changes

2. **Compression**

   - Add backup compression support
   - Optimize S3 transfer sizes

3. **Multi-Region Support**

   - Cross-region backup replication
   - Geographic redundancy

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Regular restore drills
   - Backup integrity validation
   - Performance benchmarking

## Conclusion

This backup strategy provides a robust foundation for data resilience in the Vector Store component. The implementation balances performance, reliability, and operational simplicity while meeting the specified RPO and RTO targets.
